Deconstruction is ordered for buildings that are in the way.\nUsage: Press Ctrl (by default) and place a blueprint to demolish any buildings that stand in its way.\n\n[color=red]Important Note:[/color] You can now build directily from Blueprint Libary, but the grid settings wont work.\n(This is a limitation from the game. So nothing I can do)"
